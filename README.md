## Growth Mindset<br>
A growth mindset is one in which you embrace challenge are constantly trying to improve your skills.<br>
To keep myself in a growth mindset it will remember that,<br>
1. No one is good at something when they start
2. Mistakes are not bad, they are learning oppertunities
3. If someone else is better at something than me, they were once in my position

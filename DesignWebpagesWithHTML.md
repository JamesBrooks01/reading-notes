# Structure Webpages with HTML

## Wireframes

---

A wire frame is a easy and fast way of planning the designing something like a website, app or other product. It is extremely basic and non-specific, lacking anything like colors, fonts or text it is entirely focused on the planning and layout. A commonly used argument for this style of planning is that it doesn't matter what color a button is if the consumer doesn't know where it is.

### How to create a Wireframe

---

To create a wireframe requires about 6 steps.

- First you need to research things like;
    - Your audience, requirements, and determining if the project requires additional information to best fit your product.
- Prepare the research for quick reference later.
- Make sure the User Flow is well mapped out. 
    - The wireframe could get out of control quickly if you don't know things like how many screens you need and how to flow them together or how to maintain user flow to ensure maximum user self-suffiency.
- Make sure you are Drafting not Drawing. This is meant to be a rough idea of what it will look like, so don't think about the aesthetics of it, that comes later. The only four things that are important right now are;
    - How can the content be best organised?
    - What should be most prominent?
    - What will the user expect to see in certain areas?
    - What buttons will a user need to reach their desired outcome?
- Add some minor details and start testing
    - The details should be informational, simple and only telling what type of content goes where.
    - Once that's done start user tests
- Start Prototyping
    - Once all relevent information has been gathered, start building the actual wireframe.
    - When creating the Wireframe the three most important things to go for are;
        - Clarity of the design
        - Confidence in the brand. If the page turns out unpredictable, user confidence will lower.
        - Keep it Simple. Too Much Information or links will be distracting and make it harder for a user to achieve their goal.

## HTML Basics

---

HTML is a markup language that controls the structure of a page. It consists of a series of elements that you enclose content in to make it appear or act in a certain way.<br>
It can do things like

- Make a word or image link somewhere else
- Change the font settings like Bolding or Italicizing works, make text bigger or smaller, etc.

An HTML Element is composed of three parts

- The Opening tag
- The Content within
- The Closing tag

It is also commonly used with CSS to make it prettier and JavaScript to make it dynamic and more interactable.

## Semantics

---

Semantics refer to what a piece of code means. for example what does that line of code do? Why is that line there?<br>
For example, the `<h1>` element is a semantic element, it gives the text it surrounds the meaning of "Top and Biggest Heading on the page"<br>
HTML should be coded according to the data that will be displayed, not how it will be presented, that is the job of CSS.

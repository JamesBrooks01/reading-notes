## Open-Source Software Contribution

- When first making a contribution to an open source project, there are some resources to look through that can help you get started;
  - First Contributions, a repo on GitHub that is a hands-on tutorial of making a contribution to the project.
  - up-for-grabs.net is a site gathers open-source projects that actively want help.
  - goodfirstissues.com which gets all the latest issues from GitHub that are labeled "Good First Issue".
  - goodfirstissue.dev which gets popular open-source projects and helps you make your first contribution.
  - CodeTriage helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get an new open issue every day.
- For some open-source projects there are issues labeled "First-Timers-Only" and are designed to ease the contribution process more than the contribution themselves.
- To people outside the tech world, the idea of contributing to Open-Source projects is one that can be confusing as it is contributing to something without being asked, and without being paid.
- For many developers, the 5 most common reasons for contributing to an open-source project are;
  1. To Improve Coding Skills.
      - As with all skills, the best way to truly learn is through practice.
      - And unlike some other professions, by practicing in this way you can get feedback from other people easily.
  2. Gain Early Experience.
      - By showing that you have experience reading code, finding and fixing bugs and adding code to other people's projects you could elevate yourself above other candidates.
  3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition
      - Contributing to open-source projects and getting recognition from the community can motivate developers to improve their own skills and can also create opportunities, be they job offers or invitations to attend conferences or events.
      - Another is to have self-recognition and personal achievement and having your code be accepted by a big open-source project is a pretty big achievement.
  4. Greater Job Prospects
      - Contributing to an open-source project you can improve your job and career prospects and with Open-Source projects' code being available to be seen it is easier for a prospective employer to see the code you've written and be able to assess your skills as a developer.
      - It could also provide opportunities in consulting and freelance work.
  5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level
      - Much of the time, developers first come across open-source as users and sometimes the desire to improve a specific part of the project can stem from improving it for their own use either by improving certain areas or adding new features or functionalities.
      - The desire to contribute can also stem from a business level where if a business owner or company is using a piece of open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features is also a possibility.
      - With every open-source project there is also the need for non-tech skills and contributions like language translators, designers and many other professionals can also use their skills and experience to improve the software.

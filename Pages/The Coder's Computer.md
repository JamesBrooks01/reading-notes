# Text Editors

A text editor for most people is a simple software that allows you to write down notes or documents for later comparison or use.<br>
For web developers and software engineers however, it can be used to create entire websites. However, not all text editors are created equally. For most people the text editor that comes with the operating system is sufficient as they don't need the other features that come with a text editor built for coding.

## Basic Text Editors vs Coding Built Text Editors

    Each operating system comes with its own text editor; with Windows it's Notepad, With Mac it's called Text Edit, and each Linux distribution has it's own text editor with each one called something different. And each one serves it purpose as well as each other, but it can only type in plain text and has no additional features for coding.<br>
    In comparison, text editors built for coding have features like code completion, syntax highlighting, multiple themes, and a variety of extensions. But what do these feature do?

### Code Completion

    Code completion allows you to start typing a word or command and the text editor will display possible suggestions based on what you have typed. This allows you to both save time not needing to always type out lengthy commands and reduce the chance of typos that can break code.
    Also, some text editors have the automatic closing of containing symbols like brackets and quotations reducing time spent fiddling with symbols and more time coding.

### Syntax Highlighting

    Syntax highlighting colors the text as you write it, making different parts of the code different colours to both make the text easier to read and faster to find errors.

### Themes

    Anyone who has spent a significant period of time working on a computer knows that staring at the same thing for a long time can cause strain and fatigue on the eyes. This is where having a variety of themes to choose from can help out. Themes allow you to change the color of the both the background and the text itself with most choosing a dark background with brightly coloured text which is easier on the eyes. But, each person is different and it's encouraged to find the theme that works best for you.

### Extensions

    Extensions cover everything else that a developer would need. If a developer needs a new feature, then it's likely that an extension exists to fit that need.

## Text Editor vs IDE

    A text editor by itself is all well and good, but it can't do much by itself. You can write all the code you want but without other software it can't do anything. This is where an Integrated Development Enviroment or IDE comes in.<br>
    An IDE is a package of software all together. It is a Text Editor, A File Manager, a Compiler, and a Debugger. An easy way to think about it is like a program like Outlook. Outlook contains an email client, a calendar, a task manager, and a to-do list all together.

# Design Webpages With CSS

## What is CSS

CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that lets you make your websites look great. HTML by itelf gives the website structure, it puts all the data onto the website, but it looks terrible. Everything is aligned to the left of the screen and it is in a line of the order it was written. CSS allows you to control how the HTML elements look in the browser.<br>
It allows you to for example change the color and size of the Headings and Links in the document. Or creating the layout you want, turning a single columm of text into a main content area and a sidebar with related information.

## CSS Syntax

CSS runs on rules which you define by specifying the area of the page or group of items that will be affecting and then applying it to them. For example, "I want the main heading on the page to have a Red Background and Yellow Text."<br>
Each rule opens with the Selector that defies what is being affected. Then within the curly braces "{ }" you make one or more declarations which are formed with a property and a value. The property defines what about the element is being changed and the value defines what it is changed to. Each property has different values it will accept, for example Color will take a Color Value. For Example,<br>

`h1 {`<br>
    `color : white;`<br> 
    `font-size: 12px;`<br>
`}`

Would make the text of the heading White and 12 pixels tall.

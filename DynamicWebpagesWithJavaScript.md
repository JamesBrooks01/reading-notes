# Dynamic Webpages with JavaScript

## What is JavaScript

---

JavaScript is a lightweight object oriented langieage best known for its use as a scripting language for Web pages, but has been used in other non-browser enviroments as well like Adobe Acrobat.<br>
It is not to be confused with Java which is a programming language which has very different syntax, semantics and use.
## Imput and Output in JavaScript

---

JavaScript allows you to do things like have the web page change or react to user input. Such as a question box that asks for your name, and then says Hello using your name.

## JavaScript Variables

---

JavaScript uses variables as a container to store data, and this data can be Dynamic or Static. There have been three main ways to assign a value or data to a variable;

- var
    - Which was the first and has since fell out of use for better options
- let
    - Let assigns data to a variable that can change to meet different conditons
- const
    - Const assigns data to a static variable, or a variable that remains the same after it has been declared.

Once the variables have data in them, they can be compared using a statement like an `if else` statement where `if` the values are the same, different, or whatever comparison the statement makes is `true`, it does something specific and `else` if the comparison is `false`.<br> 
The two most common comparisons are

- `===` for a direct comparison where the data has to be identical in both content and type of data
- `==` for a less specific comparison where the data just has to match, but the type can be different

# GitHub & Website Languages

While most modern software engineers and coders will manage their code through tools like GitHub to handle versioning and interaction with other coders, it exist as only part of the puzzle. One of the other parts is how to display and market your code to other people.<br>
In the modern world, most publicly available software is distributed through Websites, which provide the links, documentation, downloads and other important things necessary for people to understand what a program does.<br>
However, to generate a website requires another tool. HTML(HyperText Markup Language). HTML is one of the basic codes that websites run on, without HTML, websites wouldn't know how to arrange themselves and look all neat and organised. But, while HTML gives its users significant control, it's slow to use.<br>
That is where tools like Markdown come in.

# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a tool created to help speed up the process. It replaces the slow HTML syntax with its own faster and simpler syntax that when done writing converts itself into an HTML format to be used on websites. It uses symbols like `#` for headings, `-`'s for paragraphs, or `*`'s for bolding and italicizing rather than the slow method of writing out a code like `<em>code</em>` every time you want to italicize a word.

# GitHub Pages

GitHub has also created a tool to further help software developers create a website by creating a tool that turns the repositories(Where all the code lives) into a neat and presentable website formatted by the Markdown syntax you input into the documents within the Repository.

# Code Examples

Using Markdown, I can quickly input things like a [link][1] to the Markdown syntax cheat sheet. or an image of a duck,
